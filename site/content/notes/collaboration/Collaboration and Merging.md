# Refereals

- [Automerge](https://automerge.org/) using CRDT implementation
- [Google Docs]() using the same inplementation
- [WebRTC](https://webrtc.org/) enabling **real time** communication : server less apporach. More of a P2P approach
- [MPL](https://github.com/automerge/mpl) P2P Document synchronisation system for automerge
- Think about [Web Sockets]() for client/server communications

# Notes

- [[Json like abstraction in Automerge]] for application data.
